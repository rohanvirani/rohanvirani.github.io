Welcome! The SparkNotes summary on me is I am pursuing a Masters in Computer Science at Stanford University with a specialisation in Aritificial Intelligence. My research interests lie in active inference and causal discovery, while my actual interests range from politics and economics to biotechnology and back again. I'm a jazz pianist and musical fiend. Perhaps most importantly, I'm still searching for a domain/problem to fall in love with.
